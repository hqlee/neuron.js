# Changelog


When version <= **5.0.0**, all applications are under complete control by us, so the increasement of versions goes a little fast.

The main interfaces of neuron are not used by human users, and we completely separate logic of page configurations and static JavaScript files, so, actually developers will not aware about the API changes of neuron.

So, we make every move clean and fast.

### 7.x

- **7.0.0**:
  - [#127][127]: No longer supports dynamic combo, and removes `config.ext`.
  - [#121][121]: Supports cyclic dependencies and shadow module which could run modules according to different dependency graph.

### 6.x

- **6.2.0**: 
  - [#118][118]: Redesigns `facade`
  - [#114][114]: Redesigns and removes `config.ext`
  - [#96][96]: Supports [File Modules](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_file_modules), `require()` directories, `__dirname` and `__filename`.
- **6.1.0**: [#108][108]: Neuron will never fake ranges. No longer supports cookie configurations. Removes `'latest'` range.
- **6.0.0**: [#102][102]: Better versioning. No dependency mediation, unlike Maven. Removes both `config.ranges` and `config.depTree`, and merge them into `config.tree`.

### 5.x

- **5.1.0**: Supports `require.resolve`; Supports to facade an entry; Prohibits to load a module id with version.
- **5.0.0**: <del>**4.5.0**:</del> Factory functions now only executes when `require()`d. Updates major version that it might affected circular dependencies. Fixes circular dependencies, #83 - #85.

### 4.x

- **4.4.0**: Removes support for configurations on script node.
- **4.3.0**: `require` method will throw an error if module is not found.
- **4.2.0**: Supports dynamic combo(#66). Refractors inner logic and reduces total size. `require.async` will no longer accept array as the first argument.
- **4.1.0**: Adds a new distribution file without the polyfill of ECMAScript5.
- **4.0.0**: Changes APIs. loader -> neuron. Removed `config.ns`.

### 3.x

- **3.7.0**: Completely refractored path calculation and fixes the problem that `require.async` might load a wrong module.
- **3.6.0**: Adds a new config `ext` to define the file extension of the package file.
- **3.5.0**: Supports `require.async` and adds a new option `options.asyncDeps` for method `define`.
- **3.3.0**: Supports ranges of package version
- **3.2.0**: Adds a new config `preload` for the mode of passive module loading. Explode private method `._load` for testing.
- **3.1.0**: Completely refractored. Supports semantic versions.
